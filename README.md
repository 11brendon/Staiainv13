# Staiainv13
This is a port of Staiain's 3.95 theme

This theme is not made from scratch, it is a very heavily modified version of Til Death

Will add credits when finished.

This theme is only compatible with 4:3 aspect ratio currently, so a 16:9 port will be made after this theme is finished. 

Working on getting 0.62.1 features integrated but the theme will still work on it and previous versions.
