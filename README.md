Below is the original readme, but here is an update:

I am currently working on porting the theme to 0.64. I will not be updating this repo until I have 100% completed it. I am starting from a 0.64 til death base theme because of how many optimizations and changes have been made in recent updates. This also means I will be putting time and focus into making the theme natively compatible with 16:9 as well.

# Staiainv13
This is a port of Staiain's 3.95 theme

This theme is not made from scratch, it is a very heavily modified version of Til Death

Will add credits when finished.

This theme is only compatible with 4:3 aspect ratio currently, so a 16:9 port will be made after this theme is finished. 

Working on getting 0.62.1 features integrated but the theme will still work on it and previous versions.
